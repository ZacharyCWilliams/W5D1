# W5D1 - HTML Project

## Overview

For this homework assignment, we had to use HTML to create a recipe.

## Technical

We used a wide array of HTML5 elements to create this `index.html` page. We:

* Utilized the html:5 tab feature
* Created headers, sections, and forms
* Built out option dropdowns and labels
* Used anchor tags to link both externally and internally
* Added nav, figure, and figcaption containers
* Integrated select, input, and option elements
* Talked about thinking in boxes and the mindset behind architecting structured HTML pages
